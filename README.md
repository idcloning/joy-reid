# MSNBC Reportedly Cancels Joy Reid Show in Major Network Shakeup

## Joy Reid Show Cancelled in Network Reshuffle

MSNBC has reportedly canceled *The ReidOut*, the primetime show hosted by Joy Reid, as part of a larger lineup reshuffle at the network. The cancellation comes under the leadership of MSNBC’s new president, Rebecca Kutler, signaling a significant shift in programming strategy.

According to sources speaking with *The New York Times*, Joy Reid’s 7 p.m. show will be coming to an end this week. MSNBC plans to replace the time slot with a new program featuring a trio of co-hosts: Symone Sanders-Townsend, Alicia Menendez, and Michael Steele.

## Joy Reid Fired? What Led to the MSNBC Shakeup?

The cancellation of *The ReidOut* follows a series of internal changes at MSNBC. The network’s former president, Rashida Jones, stepped down last month, paving the way for Rebecca Kutler to take charge. Under Kutler’s leadership, MSNBC is expected to undergo broader strategic modifications.

Additionally, NBC News has faced internal controversy in recent months. The hiring and subsequent removal of former RNC chair Ronna McDaniel sparked significant backlash, with Joy Reid and other network figures vocally opposing the move. Reid notably praised NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde for listening to employee concerns and reversing the decision.

## What’s Next for MSNBC and Joy Reid?

With MSNBC undergoing a programming overhaul, the future of Joy Reid at the network remains uncertain. While there has been no official confirmation regarding whether Reid has been fired or reassigned, speculation continues about her next steps.

MSNBC’s decision to replace *The ReidOut* marks a pivotal moment in its political coverage. The addition of Symone Sanders-Townsend and Michael Steele to primetime further reflects the network’s evolving strategy under Rebecca Kutler’s leadership.

As MSNBC continues its reshuffle, audiences will be watching closely to see how the network adapts and whether Joy Reid will find a new platform within the MSNBC lineup.
